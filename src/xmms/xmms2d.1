.SH DESCRIPTION
XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS (http://legacy.xmms2.org) music player. It features a client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organise your music.
.PP
.B xmms2d
is the daemon through which XMMS2 clients playback and manage music. A client library provided allows third parties to easily write XMMS2 clients, especially using the Python and Ruby bindings.
.PP
.B xmms2d
uses a three part method to playback music. Music is accessed from disk or network using a transport plugin, the data is then passed on to a decoder plugin which decodes the audio into a form that can be played back by an output plugin. 
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General options
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Decrease verbosity.
.TP
.BI \-p\  dir ,\ \-\-plugindir= dir
Use plugin directory
.IR dir .
.TP
.BI \-o\  plugin ,\ \-\-output= plugin
Use output plugin
.IR plugin .
.TP
.BI \-i\  url ,\ --ipc-socket= url
Listen to socket at
.IR url .
Multiple sockets can be specified seperated by
.BR ; -characters.
See section
.BR IPC\ SOCKET .
.TP
.BI \-c\  file ,\ \-\-conf= file
Use configuration file
.IR file .
.TP
.BI \-s\  fd ,\ \-\-status-fd= fd
Write to filedescriptor
.I fd
when started. This can be used to wait until inter-process communication (IPC) is up, as for instance
.BR xmms2-launcher (1)
does.
.TP
.B \-\-yes\-run\-as\-root
Allow
.B xmms2d
to be run as root.
.SS Getting help
.TP
.B \-h, \-?, \-\-help
Display basic help information and exit.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Display version information.
.SH "IPC SOCKET"
XMMS2 clients use IPC sockets to communicate with
.BR xmms2d .
These IPC sockets are specified in an URL based format with three possible transport methods: unix, tcp, and tcp6.
.PP
The TCP methods allow clients to connect over IPv4 and IPv6 to
.B xmms2d
and therefore allow remote control of XMMS2. A typical IPC socket url using TCP is
.IR tcp://127.0.0.1:9667 .
.PP
The UNIX transport method is for local clients only and creates a file through which XMMS2 clients can access
.BR xmms2d .
A typical IPC socket path using the UNIX transport is
.IR unix:///tmp/xmms-ipc-foobar .
.SH FILES
Below
.I CONFDIR
is
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xmms2
on UNIX if the
.BR XDG_CONFIG_HOME -environment
variable is set. Otherwise it is
.I $HOME/.config/xmms2
(UNIX except Darwin), or
.I $HOME/Library/xmms2
(Darwin).
On Win32 it is
.IR %APPDATA%/xmms2 .
.TP
.IR CONFDIR/xmms2.conf
An XML formatted configuration file that allows changing the settings of
.BR xmms2d .
.TP
.IR CONFDIR/startup.d/
A directory populated with programs that are run when
.B xmms2d
is executed.
An alternative location can be specified in the configuration file.
.TP
.IR CONFDIR/shutdown.d/
A directory populated with programs that are run when
.B xmms2d
is shutdown correctly.
An alternative location can be specified in the configuration file.
.TP
.IR CONFDIR/medialib.db
An
.BR sqlite3 (1)
database that includes information about each song that has been added the the XMMS2 media library.
An alternative location can be specified in the configuration file.
.TP
.IR CONFDIR/bindata/
A directory that contains files with binary data entrusted to the XMMS2 media library, such as cover art.
An alternative location can be specified in the configuration file.
.TP
.I /tmp/xmms-ipc-USER
The typical location for the UNIX IPC Socket. Here
.I USER
is the name of the user that executed
.BR xmms2d .
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME
The path where the XMMS2 configuration files and resources are located.
.TP
.B XMMS_PATH
The url of the first socket that
.B xmms2d
listens to. This environment variable is set for programs in the startup and shutdown directories.
.TP
.B XMMS_PATH_FULL
A
.BR ; -seperated
list of paths to which
.B xmms2d
listens. This environment variable is set for programs in the startup and shutdown directories.
