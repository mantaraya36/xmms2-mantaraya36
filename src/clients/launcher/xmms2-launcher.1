.SH DESCRIPTION
XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS (http://legacy.xmms2.org) music player. It features a client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organise your music.
.PP
.B xmms2-launcher
starts
.BR xmms2d (1)
in the background. The main feature is that it does not exit until the IPC system of XMMS2 is available, meaning that as soon as the

process has exited successfully
.BR xmms2d (1)
is ready to accept commands.
