	/** Decode an URL-encoded string.
	 *
	 * Some strings (currently only the url of media) have no known
	 * encoding, and must be encoded in an UTF-8 clean way. This is done
	 * similarly to the url encoding web browsers do. This functions decodes
	 * a string encoded in that way. OBSERVE that the decoded string HAS
	 * NO KNOWN ENCODING and you cannot display it on screen in a 100%
	 * guaranteed correct way (a good heuristic is to try to validate the
	 * decoded string as UTF-8, and if it validates assume that it is an
	 * UTF-8 encoded string, and otherwise fall back to some other
	 * encoding).
	 *
	 * Do not use this function if you don't understand the
	 * implications. The best thing is not to try to display the url at
	 * all.
	 *
	 * Note that the fact that the string has NO KNOWN ENCODING and CAN
	 * NOT BE DISPLAYED does not stop you from open the file if it is a
	 * local file (if it starts with "file://").
	 *
	 * @param encoded_url the url-encoded string
	 * @return the decoded string in an unknown encoding
